An excitable creative thinker with a passion for heartfelt communication, digital craftsmanship and adventure. I've started and worked for creative businesses in the art and design worlds in the UK and North Africa. Frequently described as a people-person. Occasionally described as a trouble-maker.



## Skills


### Programming

I love to code. I built my first website soon after graduating as way to show my work to the world. This quickly led to requests from friends and colleagues, and these requests grew into a business partnering with some incredible people to help them better communicate who they are online - in the process becoming conversant in PHP, HTML, CSS/SCSS, JQuery and version control.

Between December 2015 and April 2016 I attended Makers Academy, Europe's leading programming bootcamp, where I added some foundational skills writing projects in Ruby and JavaScript, and an understanding of best practices including TDD, XP, Agile software development and version control in teams.


### Activating & Self-starting

In 2005 I co-founded The Royal Standard, an artist-led gallery, studios and social-workspace in a former pub in Liverpool. We were home to 25 studio members, and curated shows featuring artists from around the world. We punched way above our weight, and hosted a number of critically-acclaimed events and exhibitions. To my immense pride, the organisation is still going from strength-to-strength.

In 2008 I moved house with my young family from Liverpool to Marrakech, Morocco, with our possessions in the back of a pickup-truck. There, with my wife, I co-founded Mighty Oak Creative, a small digital agency building websites for amazing people and businesses in Morocco and the UK.


### Communication

Creative communication is the common thread running through my career. As a designer and front-end developer I've designed and built websites working with people and projects on three continents. As an artist and curator I've won awards and shown work in galleries nationally and internationally. I have extensive experience delivering talks and lectures to arts audiences and university students.

Between 2006-2008 I worked as Digital Content and Communications Co-ordinator for Liverpool Biennial, helping to attract a record-breaking 500,000 people to the festival that year. At the end of my time at Makers Academy I was selected as one of three Alumni Helpers, supporting the next cohort as they worked through the second part of the course.


### Design Thinking & Problem Solving

I have a keen interest in good design thinking, and I believe that it's crucial to every stage of web development - I'm as passionate about excellent domain modeling as I am about a beautiful and effective UI. I've designed and built websites and web apps, created identities and produced print, as an individual and in teams.

In hand with a love for design thinking is a passion for problem solving. Running a publicly- and privately-funded arts venue meant constantly thinking on my feet to keep things moving. Living and running a business in North Africa for 5 years meant finding solutions to new cultural and practical challenges almost every day. During my time at Makers Academy I learnt to professionalise these skills as a developer in the context of XP and Agile software development.
