## Skills


### Programming

I love to code. I built my first website in 2003 as an undergraduate as a way to show my work to the world. This quickly led to requests from friends and colleagues, and these requests grew into a business partnering with some incredible people to help them better communicate who they are online - in the process becoming conversant in PHP, HTML, CSS/SASS, and JavaScript.

Between December 2015 and April 2016 I attended Makers Academy, Europe's leading programming bootcamp, where I added some deeper skills writing projects in Ruby and JavaScript, and fell in love with some healthy foundational development practices - including pair programming, TDD, Agile software development practices and version control in teams.

Since August 2016 I've been a developer and tech lead at Alliants, where I've mainly been writing Ruby on Rails apps for a major luxury hotel brand - ranging from large internal CRM applications to nimble APIs for mobile clients.


### Activating & Self-starting

In 2005 I co-founded The Royal Standard, an artist-led gallery, studios and social-workspace in a former pub in Liverpool.

We were home to 25 studio members, and curated shows featuring artists from around the world. We punched way above our weight, and hosted a number of critically-acclaimed events and exhibitions. To my immense pride, the organisation is still going from strength-to-strength.

In 2008 I moved house with my young family from Liverpool to Marrakech, Morocco, with our possessions in the back of a pickup-truck. There, in 2012, I co-founded Mighty Oak Creative, a small digital agency building websites for amazing people and businesses in Morocco and the UK.

In three years we built sites for over 20 clients, many of whom we worked with multiple times - in one case we built 5 sites for the same successful travel specialist.


### Communication

Creative communication is the common thread running through my career. As a designer and front-end developer I've designed and built websites working with people and projects on three continents.

As an artist and curator I've won awards and shown work in galleries nationally and internationally. I have extensive experience delivering talks and lectures to arts audiences and university students.

Between 2006-2008 I worked as Digital Content and Communications Co-ordinator for Liverpool Biennial, project-managing the launch of a Â£50k web platform that helped to attract a record-breaking 500,000 people to the festival that year.

At the end of my time at Makers Academy I was selected as one of three Alumni Helpers, supporting the next cohort as they worked through the course.

In my role at Alliants I'm part of the management team, responsible for looking after a small team of developers, as well as working closely with clients, service providers and members of our team in Toronto - all of which demands the ability to communicate clearly, appropriately and effectively.


### Design Thinking & Problem Solving

I have a keen interest in good design thinking, and I believe that it's crucial to every stage of web development - I'm as passionate about excellent domain modelling and system architecture as I am about a beautiful and effective UI. I've designed and built websites and web apps, created identities and produced print, as an individual and in teams.

In hand with a love for design thinking is a passion for problem solving. Running a publicly- and privately-funded arts venue meant constantly thinking on my feet to keep things moving.

Living and running a business in North Africa for 5 years meant finding solutions to new cultural and practical challenges almost every day. During my time at Makers Academy I learnt to professionalise these skills as a developer in the context of XP and Agile software development.

## Not Work

A secret Welshman, I currently live on the South Coast of England with my wife, three grubby, intrepid kids, Sparrow the Whippet and 5 rescue chickens (that's chickens that have been rescued, rather than superhero poultry). When I'm not working or hanging out with the family, I'm generally outside fixing something or hiding somewhere with a book. Our family motto is: "Of course it's going wrong, that's why it's called an Adventure".
